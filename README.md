 ## Projects

This project is an end to end data science project. The data used is from kaggle dataset of cardekho. In this project, the data is cleaned, preprocessed and visualized. Random Forest regression model is used to train the model. Then it is deployed using Flask. The following insights were obtained while doing this project.
1. In Chennai, most of the cars that are on the portal have been driven more kilometers. 
2. Second place is shared by Jaipur, Hyderabad and Pune with respect to number of kms driven. 
3. More the number of Kilometers a car travels, it's resale value reduces gradually. 
4. It is seen that first owners of the car have driven more number of kms compared to second, third and fourth & Above owners.
5. Less the number of Kilometers a car travelled, we can keep more margin while selling it and can increase more revenue. 
6. Also, if a car is more than 10 yrs old, then we can keep high margin to assure them that their vehicle gets sold.

This project has helped me in gaining insights with time-series data generated from smart IoT devices, analyze the weather influence on electricity consumption, and apply a regression model using Scikit-learn to predict the electricity consumption of a building.

In this project, three Machine Learning algorithms namely Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XG-Boost were used to predict used cars prices respectively. The application of this project can be used by car dealerships/individuals to predict used car prices and understand the key factors that contribute to used car prices.

In this project, Data is pre-processed, cleaned and visualized, followed by training XG-Boost classifier to predict whether a person has a risk of having cervical cancer. Cervical cancer kills about 4,000 women in the U.S. and about 300,000 women worldwide every year.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/arlearn-abitha/Portfolio/blob/master/images/fulls/05.png"> **[Data Analysis (Basic Statistics in Python - Correlation & T-tests)](https://github.com/arlearn-abitha/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20Mini%20projects/Data%20Analysis%20based%20on%20(corr%20%26%20t-test))**
 
In this Data Analysis project, the dataset is obtained from world bank under the category science and technology. Then cleaning of dataset started with removal of missing data and unnecessary columns from our dataset. Next, proceeded towards Exploratory data analysis and used boxplots to detect outliers. Later, examined the relationships between different features using correlation and scatter plots. Finally concluded the project by performing t-tests.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/arlearn-abitha/Portfolio/blob/master/images/fulls/06.png"> **[Python notifier](https://github.com/arlearn-abitha/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Python%20personal%20notification%20projects)**
 
In this project, I have created 2 personal notifiers.
Personal Breaks Notifier: I wanted myself a reminder to take a break every once an hour for 15 minutes. So created this application.</br>
COVID-19 notifier: This app fetches the covid cases data from heroku API, and then displays as notification on my screen. It helps me in getting live updates on what's happening in India regarding Pandemic.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/arlearn-abitha/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/stroke_predict.png"> **[Stroke Prediction Project](https://github.com/arlearn-abitha/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Stroke%20Prediction%20Project)**

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient. In this project, after doing data analysis, I got the following inferences. 
1. Stroke is occuring in people who are 30+ years old. 
2. Those who have avg_glucose_level less than 120 have more chance of getting a stroke. 
3. Those who have avg_glucose_level more than 150 have high chance of getting a stroke. 
4. Following that, I have used Decision Tree Classifier to predict stroke. 
5. The obtained score of prediction is 0.90215
