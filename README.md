This project is an end to end data science project. The data used is from kaggle dataset of cardekho. In this project, the data is cleaned, preprocessed and visualized. Random Forest regression model is used to train the model. Then it is deployed using Flask.

This project has helped me in gaining insights with time-series data generated from smart IoT devices, analyze the weather influence on electricity consumption, and apply a regression model using Scikit-learn to predict the electricity consumption of a building.

In this project, three Machine Learning algorithms namely Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XG-Boost were used to predict used cars prices respectively. The application of this project can be used by car dealerships/individuals to predict used car prices and understand the key factors that contribute to used car prices.

In this project, Data is pre-processed, cleaned and visualized, followed by training XG-Boost classifier to predict whether a person has a risk of having cervical cancer. Cervical cancer kills about 4,000 women in the U.S. and about 300,000 women worldwide every year.

## Experience:

I bring with me 5 years and 7 months of interdisciplinary work experience such as:
1. Being a Cofounder to a tech start-up for 2+ years which helped me in taking initiatives and being accountable for my actions in terms of Leadership, team work etc.
2. Being a Business Development Manager & Scientific Business Manager at VPKW and Privi LS LLP for 2+ years in Pharma/ Life Science industry doing B2B sales has helped me nurture my soft skills such as persuasive communication technique, collaboration, follow up, problem solving, being punctual, negotiation, and persuasive approach for win-win situation etc. 
3. Being a Technical Support Associate at IBM for 11 months has given me exposure to work with US based customers.
