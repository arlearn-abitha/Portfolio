# Data Science Portfolio - Abitha Ravishankar
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my Experience, skills, and certificates. It is updated on the regular basis.

## Experience:

I bring with me 5 years and 7 months of interdisciplinary work experience such as:
1. Being a Cofounder to a tech start-up for 2+ years which helped me in taking initiatives and being accountable for my actions in terms of Leadership, team work etc.
2. Being a Business Development Manager & Scientific Business Manager at VPKW and Privi LS LLP for 2+ years in Pharma/ Life Science industry doing B2B sales has helped me nurture my soft skills such as persuasive communication technique, collaboration, follow up, problem solving, being punctual, negotiation, and persuasive approach for win-win situation etc. 
3. Being a Technical Support Associate at IBM for 11 months has given me exposure to work with US based customers. 



## Projects

This project has helped me in gaining insights with time-series data generated from smart IoT devices, analyze the weather influence on electricity consumption, and apply a regression model using Scikit-learn to predict the electricity consumption of a building.

In this project, we used 3 Machine Learning algorithms namely Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XG-Boost to predict used cars prices. The application of this project can be used by car dealerships to predict used car prices and understand the key factors that contribute to used car prices.

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and userâ€™s tweets (Content-based filtering).

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.
